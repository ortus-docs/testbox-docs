# Overview

TestBox is a next generation testing framework for ColdFusion \(CFML\) that is based on BDD \(Behavior Driven Development\) for providing a clean obvious syntax for writing tests. It contains not only a testing framework, runner, assertions, mocking/stubbing and expectations library. It also supports xUnit style of testing with MXUnit compatibilities.
