# MockBox

![MockBox](../../.gitbook/assets/mockbox_300.png)

## Introduction

TestBox includes a mocking and stubbing library we lovingly call MockBox.  You don't have to install it or have a separate libary, it is part of TestBox.

MockBox shines by allowing you to create mock and stub objects.

### Important Setup

Write capabilities on disk for the default path of `/testbox/system/testings/stubs`. 

You can also choose the directory destination for stub creations yourself when you initialize TestBox. If using ColdFusion 9 or Lucee you can even use `ram://` and use the virtual file system.
