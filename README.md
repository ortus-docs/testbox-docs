# TestBox & MockBox Manual v2.2.0

![TestBox](images/TestBoxLogo300.png)

TestBox is a next generation testing framework for ColdFusion (CFML) that is based on [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (Behavior Driven Development) for providing a clean obvious syntax for writing tests. It contains not only a testing framework, runner, assertions and expectations library but also ships with MockBox for mocking and stubbing. It also supports xUnit style of testing and MXUnit compatibilities.

![MockBox](images/MockBox_300.png)

MockBox is a companion package to TestBox that will give you advanced mocking/stubbing capabilities; hence a Mocking Framework.
