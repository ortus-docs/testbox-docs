# TestBox xUnit Primer

TestBox is a xUnit style and behavior-driven development \(BDD\) testing framework for CFML \(ColdFusion\). It does not depend on any other framework for operation and it has a clean and descriptive syntax that will make you giggle when writing your tests. It ships with not only the xUnit and BDD testing capabilities, but also an assertions and expectations library, several different runners, reporters and MockBox, for mocking and stubbing capabilities.

> **Info** Note: This article is a primer to get you started with the xUnit capabilities of TestBox, if you would like to explore the BDD style capabilities of TestBox we recommend you visit _the BDD primer chapter_.
