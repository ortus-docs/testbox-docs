# Testing Styles

TestBox comes with two flavors of testing: [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) and [xUnit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit). 

BDD stands for **behavior driven development** and is highly based on creating specifications and expectations of results in a readable DSL (Domain Specifc Language).

xUnit style of testing is the more traditional TDD or **test driven development** approach where you are creating a test case CFC that matches the software under test and for each method in the SUT you create a test method in the test case CFC. We cover these two topics in our primers chapter (Chapter 3).

No matter what testing style you pick you, TestBox will execute the tests for you and then send your results to a reporter that can produce awesome testing reports for you.
